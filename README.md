# Blazor: Easily switch between client side and server side execution


Blazor as part of .Net is shipping as a generally available release. Blazor is supported with both server side and client side execution models. If you are planning a full wasm client deployment it is still useful to switch to server side for debug purposes.

## Prerequisites

Visual Studio 2022 17.2.0 (or more recent) and .Net 6.



## Solution configurations


There are four configurations in the solution. Using the Visual Studio configuration manager you can choose between debug and release and also between client side &amp; server side execution. The key differences in each configuration is the definition of either BlazorWebAssembly or BlazorServer and DEBUG or RELEASE defined constants.



## Solution projects



The names of the projects may seem a bit odd; Just understand that this project was pared down from a very large project 'in progress' and in the large project the names make sense. The solution is architected in an MVVM style. Most of what appears in the demo project are some of the view components.



##### GeneralComponents



This project is a Net 6 Razor Class Library which implements the UI and backing logic. GeneralComponents contains the usual Blazor suspects of MainLayout.razor, NavMenu.razor, and the _Imports.razor files. This project does not change with the server or client side execution.



##### Optimiser.Blazor



This project is a Net 6 Blazor client app defined by program.cs &amp; startup.cs with the packages of "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor" and "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Build". It is only invoked for a client side execution, it is totally ignored for server side execution.



##### Optimiser.Web



This project is a Net 6 server. It uses the defined constants to determine if it is going to host the Blazor project on the server or to simply act as a launch pad for the client side assets. In real life the server presents a REST api for use by the client in either mode. The key to the switch is in startup.cs where the methods Startup and Configure are customized via the defined constants.
